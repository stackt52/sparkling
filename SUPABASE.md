# MCP Supabase Integration

1. Add MCP server
   Add the MCP server to your project config using the command line.
   Code:
   File: Code
```
claude mcp add --scope project --transport http supabase "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=uicqczgpiqkczwyssdft&features=docs%2Caccount%2Cdatabase%2Cdebugging%2Cdevelopment%2Cfunctions%2Cbranching"
```

2. Authenticate
   After configuring the MCP server, you need to authenticate. Run this in a regular terminal, not an IDE extension.
   Details:
   Select the supabase server, then Authenticate to begin the flow.
   Code:
   File: Code
```
claude /mcp
```

3. Install Agent Skills (optional)
   Agent Skills give AI coding tools ready-made instructions, scripts, and resources for working with Supabase more accurately and efficiently.
   Code:
   File: Code
```
npx skills add supabase/agent-skills
```
